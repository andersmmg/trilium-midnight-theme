## Installation
- Create a new note inside your Trilium Notes and set the Note Type to _CSS_
- Copy the content of the themes .css file inside the Note you just created
- Add the label _#appCss_ 
  - You can do that in the _Owned Attributes_ on the top of your note 
  - If are currently using other custom themes, make sure the midnight theme is the only one with the _#appCss_ label 
- Reload (Ctrl+R)
