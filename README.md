# midnight - Theme for Trilium Notes

A theme with soft dark colors and styling that aims to be pleasant to look at.  

*The style of the theme is familiar to the theme choices of many modern programs. For e.g. it is close to VSCode's default dark themes. The creation of this theme for trilium was mainly inspired by SiYuans (PKM Tool) midnight theme.*

## Installation
- Create a new note inside your Trilium Notes and set the Note Type to _CSS_
- Copy the content of the themes .css file inside the Note you just created
- Add the label _#appCss_ 
  - You can do that in the _Owned Attributes_ on the top of your note (Alt+A)
  - If are currently using other custom themes, make sure the midnight theme is the only one with the _#appCss_ label 
- Reload (Ctrl+R)
